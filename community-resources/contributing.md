### Participating in protocol governance

Become a [Stalkholder](../protocol-resources/glossary.md#stalkholders) and participate in Beanstalk governance by [Depositing whitelisted assets](../farm/silo.md#deposit-whitelist) in the [Silo](../farm/silo.md) to earn [Stalk](../farm/silo.md#the-stalk-system).&#x20;

Read more about [governance](../governance/beanstalk/), [governance proposals](../governance/proposals.md) and [how to vote on governance proposals](../guides/governance/vote-on-proposals.md).&#x20;

Each governance proposal has a channel for discussion on the [Beanstalk Discord](https://discord.gg/beanstalk).

### Building with Beanstalk and Beans

Beanstalk's [capital efficient model](../introduction/why-beanstalk.md) is designed to facilitate a Bean-based economy of protocols and businesses benefiting from building on Beanstalk and using Beans. Beanstalk welcomes builders and provides a competitive edge to your project.

Discuss business ideas in the **(#üí°„Éªbusiness-ideas)** channel on the Beanstalk Discord.

[Bean Sprout](../governance/bean-sprout/) is a Beanstalk accelerator program to facilitate rapid development on and around Beanstalk in a decentralized fashion. Join the **(#üå±„Éªbean-sprout)** channel on the Beanstalk Discord or DM [@WeAreBeanSprout](https://twitter.com/wearebeansprout) on Twitter to learn more.

### Submitting improvements to the Beanstalk protocol

The Beanstalk protocol is open source and developed on [GitHub](https://github.com/BeanstalkFarms/Beanstalk). The [app.bean.money](https://app.bean.money/) frontend is currently [closed source](../disclosures.md#19-closed-source-ui-risk).

Discuss improvements to Beanstalk in the **(#üí°„Éªbeanstalk-ideas)** channel or leave feedback on the Beanstalk UI in the **(#üåê„Éªui-feedback)** channel on the Beanstalk Discord.&#x20;

Protocol RFCs can be opened in the repository as [Issues](https://github.com/BeanstalkFarms/Beanstalk/issues). After development, protocol changes are submitted to [governance](../governance/beanstalk/) as [Beanstalk Improvement Proposals](../governance/proposals.md#bip) and are committed if passed by Stalkholders.&#x20;

Contributions may be eligible for [development grants](contributing.md#receiving-a-grant-for-protocol-development).

### Submitting improvements to the Beanstalk documentation

The Farmers' Almanac is continually improving and assistance is welcome.&#x20;

Leave feedback in the **(#üìú„Éªdocs-feedback)** channel on the Beanstalk Discord or make a pull request directly to the [Farmers' Almanac repository](https://github.com/BeanstalkFarms/Farmers-Almanac).

Contributions may be eligible for [community grants](contributing.md#receiving-a-grant-for-increasing-awareness-and-education).

To discuss development grants, DM @Silo Chad (YUNG MUSK#7303) on the [Beanstalk Discord](https://discord.gg/beanstalk).

### Receiving a grant for increasing awareness and education

The community grant program aims to reward community members for creating quality content about the Beanstalk ecosystem.

A budget of 30,000 Beans per month will be allocated to creators of new Beanstalk-related content that focuses on Beanstalk and its role in the broader DeFi ecosystem.
