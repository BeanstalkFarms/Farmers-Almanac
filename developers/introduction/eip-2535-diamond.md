# EIP-2535 Diamond

The Beanstalk contract is a Diamond ‚Äì a multi-facet proxy defined in [EIP-2535](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-2535) that can implement functionality from numerous different Facet contracts.

All the Facets share a common storage through the [`AppStorage`](https://dev.to/mudgen/appstorage-pattern-for-state-variables-in-solidity-3lki) pattern. Functionality is shared between Facets through internal Libraries.

Understanding EIP-2535 really helps to understand Beanstalk. This page serves as a resource hub for EIP-2535.
