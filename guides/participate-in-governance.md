# Participate in Governance

Beanstalk is governed by Stalkholders. Anyone with Stalk can vote for Beanstalk Improvement Proposals (BIPs).

You can review previous and outstanding BIPs by visiting [GitHub](https://github.com/BeanstalkFarms/Beanstalk/tree/master/bips) and the [Beanstalk DAO Snapshot page](https://snapshot.org/#/beanstalkdao.eth).

### **Vote For a BIP**

1. Navigate to the [Beanstalk DAO Snapshot page](https://snapshot.org/#/beanstalkdao.eth).
2. Click on the active BIP you wish to vote for.
3. Under the “Cast your vote” section, click the “For” choice.
4. Click “Vote” and then click “Vote” again in the modal.
5. Click "Sign" on the message when prompted by MetaMask.
6. If your MetaMask is connected to a hardware wallet, sign the message on your hardware wallet.

### **Unvote For a BIP**

Note: Abstaining is the same as selecting the “Abstain” choice on a BIP. It is not possible to remove a vote on Snapshot, so the “Abstain” choice exists to allow Farmers to unvote after voting for a BIP.

1. Navigate to the [Beanstalk DAO Snapshot page](https://snapshot.org/#/beanstalkdao.eth).
2. Click on the active BIP you wish to unvote for.
3. Under the “Cast your vote” section, click the “Abstain” choice.
4. Click “Vote” and then click “Vote” again in the modal.
5. Click "Sign" on the message when prompted by MetaMask.
6. If your MetaMask is connected to a hardware wallet, sign the message on your hardware wallet.
