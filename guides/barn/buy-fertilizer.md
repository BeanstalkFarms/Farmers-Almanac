# Buy Fertilizer

Beanstalk is hosting the Barn Raise — a fundraiser to restore $77M in non-Bean liquidity stolen from the Silo. The Barn Raise started on **June 6, 2022**.

Active Fertilizer holders receive Sprouts Sprouts become redeemable for Beans on a [pari passu](../../protocol/glossary.md#pari-passu) basis. See the [Barn](../../farm/barn.md) page for more info.

1. Make sure you are on [app.bean.money](https://app.bean.money/) and [connect your wallet](../getting-started/connect-wallet.md).
2. Navigate to the “Barn” page.
3. The Available Fertilizer is displayed in the "Barn Conditions" component. Available Fertilizer is a function of how much Unripe BEAN:3CRV LP is left to be recapitalized. See [Fertilizer](../../farm/barn.md#fertilizer) for additional information.
4. In the “Buy” tab, there is a dropdown menu to select the token you would like to use to buy Fertilizer.
5. Enter the amount of the selected token you want to use to buy Fertilizer.
   * The amount of Fertilizer received rounds down to the nearest USDC.
6. A transaction preview will appear below the inputs. Select the “Transaction Details” dropdown to review each step of the transaction.
7. You may select a slippage tolerance by selecting the gear icon. The default slippage tolerance is 0.1%.
8. If you are buying Fertilizer with ETH or have previously approved the asset being spent, skip to Step 10. For all other assets, select “Approve \[Token]”. This allows the Beanstalk contract to spend the asset, but does not use it to buy and Sow Beans yet.
9. Confirm the approval transaction in your wallet, and your hardware wallet, if applicable. You should verify that the transaction is interacting with the [correct contract](../../protocol/contracts.md) before signing it.
10. Select “Buy”.
11. Confirm the transaction in your wallet and your hardware wallet, if applicable. You should verify that the transaction is interacting with the [correct contract](../../protocol/contracts.md) before signing it.
