# Transfer Fertilizer

Active Fertilizer is an ERC-1155 token. ERC-1155 tokens can be transferred on OpenSea. Transferring Fertilizer to another address transfers the associated Sprouts as well. See the [Barn](../../farm/barn.md) page for more info.

1. Go your [OpenSea](https://opensea.io/account) account and connect your wallet.
2. Select the Fertilizer you would like to transfer.
3. On the top right of the page, select the send icon that says "Transfer" upon hover.
4. In the "Quantity" field, enter how many Fertilizer tokens you would like to transfer.
5. Enter the recipient address in the "Address" field.
6. Select "Transfer".
7. Confirm the transaction in your wallet and your hardware wallet, if applicable. You should verify that the transaction is interacting with the [correct contract](../../protocol/contracts.md) before signing it.
8. After the transaction has been confirmed by the network, the transferred Fertilizer (and associated Sprouts) will appear at the recipient’s address on the “Barn” page of the Beanstalk UI.
