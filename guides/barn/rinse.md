# Rinse Sprouts

Active Fertilizer holders receive Sprouts. Sprouts become Rinsable on a [pari passu](../../protocol/glossary.md#pari-passu) basis. Once Sprouts become Rinsable, they are redeemable for 1 Bean each. See the [Barn](../../farm/barn.md) page for more info.

1. Make sure you are on [app.bean.money](https://app.bean.money/) and [connect your wallet](../getting-started/connect-wallet.md).
2. Navigate to the “Barn” page.
3. Select the “Rinse” tab. The “Rinsable Balance” will be shown. These are the Sprouts that are eligible to be Rinsed for Beans.
4. Under “Destination”, select “Circulating Balance” or “Farm Balance”. Circulating Balance sends the Rinsed Beans to your wallet, separate from Beanstalk. [Farm Balance](../../protocol/asset-states.md) keeps the asset stored in Beanstalk which can save gas fees in future transactions. See [Asset States](../../protocol/asset-states.md) for more information.
5. A transaction preview will appear below the inputs. Select the “Transaction Details” dropdown to review each step of the transaction.
6. Select “Rinse Sprouts”.
7. Confirm the transaction in your wallet and your hardware wallet, if applicable. You should verify that the transaction is interacting with the [correct contract](../../protocol/contracts.md) before signing it.
8. After the transaction has been confirmed by the network, the location of your assets will depend on the option selected in Step 4:
   * If “Circulating Balance” was selected, the Beans will be in your wallet. Your Circulating Balance is also shown on the [Balances](https://app.bean.money/#/balances) page.
   * If “Farm Balance” was selected, the Beans will be shown on the [Balances](https://app.bean.money/#/balances) page.
