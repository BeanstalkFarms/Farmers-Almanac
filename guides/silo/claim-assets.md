# Claim Assets

More information about [Withdrawals](https://docs.bean.money/farm/silo#withdraw) and [Claimable Assets](https://docs.bean.money/additional-resources/glossary#claimable-assets).

1. Make sure you are on [https://app.bean.money/](https://app.bean.money/).
2. Navigate to the “Silo” page.
3. At the bottom of the page, there is a table showing the various assets on the [Deposit Whitelist](https://docs.bean.money/farm/silo#deposit-whitelist).
4. Select the asset you Withdrew and would like to Claim.
5. Select the “Claim” tab. The “Claimable Balance” will be shown. You will receive this amount of the asset after Claiming.
6. Under “Destination”, select “Circulating Balance” or “Farm Balance”. Circulating Balance returns Claimed assets to your wallet, separate from Beanstalk. [Farm Balance](https://docs.bean.money/additional-resources/glossary#farm-assets) keeps the asset stored in Beanstalk.
7. LP Tokens have a “Claim as” option that allows you to receive the asset in a different form. For example, BEAN:3CRV LP may be Claimed as BEAN:3CRV, Bean or 3CRV. If the option selected is different from the Claimable asset, the transaction will convert the Claimable asset.
   * If the transaction involves trading between assets, you may select a slippage tolerance by selecting the gear icon. The default slippage tolerance is 0.1%.
8. A transaction preview will appear below the inputs. Select the “Transaction Details” dropdown to review each step of the transaction.
9. Select “Claim”.
10. Confirm the transaction in your wallet and your hardware wallet, if applicable. You should [verify](https://docs.bean.money/additional-resources/contracts) that the transaction is interacting with the correct contract before signing it.
11. After the transaction has been confirmed by the network, the location of your assets will depend on the option selected in Step 6:
    * If “Circulating Balance” was selected, the assets will be in your wallet. Your Circulating Balance is also shown on the [Balances](https://app.bean.money/#/balances) page.
    * If “Farm Balance” was selected, the assets will be shown on the [Balances](https://app.bean.money/#/balances) page.
