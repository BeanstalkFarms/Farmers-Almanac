More information about [Depositing](https://docs.bean.money/additional-resources/glossary#deposit) in the [Silo](https://docs.bean.money/farm/silo).

1. Make sure you are on [https://app.bean.money/](https://app.bean.money/).
2. Navigate to the “Silo” page.
3. At the bottom of the page, there is a table showing the various assets on the [Deposit Whitelist](https://docs.bean.money/farm/silo#deposit-whitelist).
4. Select the asset you want to Deposit.
5. In the “Deposit” tab, there is a drop down menu to select the token you would like to Deposit.
   * For example, a Bean Deposit can be made in either Beans or ETH. ETH will be converted to Beans during the Deposit transaction.
6. Enter the amount you want to Deposit. A transaction preview showing the [Stalk and Seeds](https://docs.bean.money/farm/silo#the-stalk-system) to be received will appear below the inputs. Select the “Transaction Details” dropdown to review each step of the transaction.
7. You may select a slippage tolerance by selecting the gear icon. The default slippage tolerance is 0.1%.
8. If you are Depositing ETH, skip to Step 10. For all other assets, select “Approve \[Token]”. This allows the Beanstalk contract to spend the asset, but does not Deposit it yet.
