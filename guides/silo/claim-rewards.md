* [Mow Grown Stalk](claim-rewards.md#mow)
* [Plant Plantable Seeds](claim-rewards.md#plant)

### Mow

Mowing [Grown Stalk](../../additional-resources/glossary.md#grown-stalk) adds the Grown Stalk to your Stalk balance, which determines your governance power and portion of Bean seigniorage earned.

Note: The “Mow” function is called anytime a Farmer interacts with the Silo.

1. Make sure you are on [app.bean.money](https://app.bean.money/).
2. Navigate to the “Silo” page.
3. Select the green “Claim Rewards” button.
   * Note: You must have Grown Stalk in order to Mow.
4. Select “Mow” in the modal.
   * To the right of “Mow” there will be an estimated transaction fee based on current gas prices on Ethereum.
5. At the bottom of the modal select the green “Mow” button.
6. Confirm the transaction in your wallet and your hardware wallet, if applicable. You should verify that the transaction is interacting with the [correct contract](../../additional-resources/contracts.md) before signing it.

### Plant

Planting [Plantable Seeds](../../additional-resources/glossary.md#plantable-seeds) adds them to your Seed balance, which determines how many Grown Stalk you receive each Season. Planting also Deposits your [Earned Beans](../../additional-resources/glossary.md#earned-beans) in the current Season. [Earned Stalk](../../additional-resources/glossary.md#earned-stalk) already contributes to your Stalk ownership and does not need to be claimed, but is claimed upon Plant.
