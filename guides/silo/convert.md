# Convert in the Silo

Silo Members can participate in peg maintenance by Converting certain Deposited assets to others within the Silo. You can find more information about Conversions [here](../../peg-maintenance/convert.md).

1. Make sure you are on [app.bean.money](https://app.bean.money/) and [connect your wallet](../getting-started/connect-wallet.md).
2. Navigate to the “Silo” page.
3. At the bottom of the page, there is a table showing the various assets on the [Deposit Whitelist](../../farm/silo/#deposit-whitelist).
4. Select the asset you want to Convert from. For example, to Convert from Bean to another asset, select Bean. You must already have a Deposit of this asset in order to Convert from it. Assets may or may not be convertible at a given time based on [deltaB](../../protocol/glossary.md#deltab). See [Convert Whitelist](../../peg-maintenance/convert.md#convert-whitelist) for additional information.
5. Select “Convert” and enter the amount of the Deposited asset you would like to Convert.
6. Below the input box, select the asset to “Convert to”. Available pairs are listed in the [Current Convert Whitelist](../../peg-maintenance/convert.md#convert-whitelist).
7. A transaction preview will appear below the inputs showing the change in asset and change in [Stalk and Seeds](../../farm/silo/#the-stalk-system). Select the “Transaction Details'' dropdown to review each step of the transaction.
8. You may select a slippage tolerance by selecting the gear icon. The default slippage tolerance is 0.1%.
9. Select “Convert”.
10. Confirm the transaction in your wallet and your hardware wallet, if applicable. You should verify that the transaction is interacting with the [correct contract](../../protocol/contracts.md) before signing it.
11. After the transaction has been confirmed by the network, your Converted Deposit will appear at the “Silo” page for the asset you Converted to under the “Deposits” table.
