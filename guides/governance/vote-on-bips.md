# Vote on BIPs

Beanstalk is governed by Stalkholders. Anyone with Stalk can vote for Beanstalk Improvement Proposals (BIPs). You can read more about Beanstalk governance [here](../../governance/beanstalk/).

You can read about past BIPs on [GitHub](https://github.com/BeanstalkFarms/Beanstalk/tree/master/bips).

### **Vote For a BIP**

1. Navigate to the [Beanstalk DAO Snapshot page](https://snapshot.org/#/beanstalkdao.eth).
2. Click on the active BIP you wish to vote for.
3. Under the “Cast your vote” section, click the “For” choice.
4. Click “Vote” and then click “Vote” again in the modal.
5. Sign the message in your wallet and your hardware wallet, if applicable.

### **Unvote For a BIP**

Note: Abstaining is the same as selecting the “Abstain” choice on a BIP. It is not possible to remove a vote on Snapshot, so the “Abstain” choice exists to allow Farmers to unvote after voting for a BIP.

1. Navigate to the [Beanstalk DAO Snapshot page](https://snapshot.org/#/beanstalkdao.eth).
2. Click on the active BIP you wish to unvote for.
3. Under the “Cast your vote” section, click the “Abstain” choice.
4. Click “Vote” and then click “Vote” again in the modal.
5. Sign the message in your wallet and your hardware wallet, if applicable.
