### Fill Pod Listing <a href="#fill-pod-listing" id="fill-pod-listing"></a>

1. Make sure you are on [app.bean.money](https://app.bean.money/) and [connect your wallet](../getting-started/connect-wallet.md).
2. Navigate to the “Market” page.
3. Open Pod Listings appear below the “Buy Now” tab. This view displays all the Pod Listings, sorted by ascending [Place in Line](../../protocol/glossary.md#pod-line).
   * You may customize the sorting, display, or filtering of any column by selecting it.
   * The “Listing” # is a unique identifier for each Pod Listing.
   * The “Place in Line” is the position in the Pod Line when the Pods in the Pod Listing will start to become Harvestable.
   * The “Price per Pod” is the number of Beans requested per Pod.
   * The “Amount” is the number of Pods left to be purchased from the Pod Listing.
   * If the Pod Line moves forward by the amount in the “Expires in” field, the Pod Listing will automatically expire.
4. Select a Pod Listing to view details and to buy Pods from a Pod Listing.
