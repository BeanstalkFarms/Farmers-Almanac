# Approve Contracts

Certain transactions require approving certain smart contracts to process your transaction. When a mode is selected that requires an approval, if you have not yet approved the contract, a special notice will appear and the module will be unusable until you send an approve.

To send an approval for the transaction in question:

1. Click the "Approve" button.
2. Click "Confirm" on the transaction when prompted by MetaMask.
3. If your MetaMask is connected to a hardware wallet, confirm the transaction on your hardware wallet.\
