More information about [Harvestable Pods](https://docs.bean.money/additional-resources/glossary#harvestable-pods).

1. Make sure you are on [https://app.bean.money/](https://app.bean.money/).
2. Navigate to the “Field” page.
3. Select the “Harvest” tab. The amount of “Harvestable Pods” will be shown. These are the Pods that are eligible to be Harvested for Beans.
4. Under “Destination”, select “Circulating Balance” or “Farm Balance”. Circulating Balance sends the Beans to your wallet, separate from Beanstalk. [Farm Balance](https://docs.bean.money/additional-resources/glossary#farm-assets) keeps the Beans stored in Beanstalk.
5. A transaction preview will appear below the inputs. Select the “Transaction Details” dropdown to review each step of the transaction.
6. Select “Harvest”.
7. Confirm the transaction in your wallet and your hardware wallet, if applicable. You should [verify](https://docs.bean.money/additional-resources/contracts) that the transaction is interacting with the correct contract before signing it.
8. After the transaction has been confirmed by the network, the location of the Beans from your Harvestable Pods will depend on the option selected in Step 4:
   * If “Circulating Balance” was selected, the Beans will be in your wallet. Your Circulating Balance is also shown on the [Balances](https://app.bean.money/#/balances) page.
   * If “Farm Balance” was selected, the Beans will be shown on the [Balances](https://app.bean.money/#/balances) page.
