# Where to Begin

**New to Beanstalk?** Learn the basics by reading [Why Beanstalk](../../introduction/why-beanstalk.md) and [How Beanstalk Works](../../introduction/how-beanstalk-works.md).&#x20;

The [Beanstalk whitepaper](https://bean.money/docs/beanstalk.pdf) is the authoritative source of protocol documentation while the [Farmers' Almanac](../../) is more accessible.&#x20;

If you prefer audio content, check out the Beanstalk University recordings in the [Beanstalk Learning Center](../../community/beanstalk-learning-center.md).

**Ready to use Beans?** Participate in Beanstalk and earn yield through different components of [the Farm](../../farm/overview.md):

* **Silo:** Earn yield and participate in Beanstalk governance by [Depositing](../../protocol/glossary.md#deposit) whitelisted assets. Silo Deposits earn a portion of new Bean mints. Learn more [about the Silo](../../farm/silo.md) and how to [Deposit in the Silo](../silo/deposit.md).
* **Field:** Earn yield by [Sowing](../../protocol/glossary.md#sow) (lending) Beans to Beanstalk. Lenders receive [Pods](../../protocol/glossary.md#pods), which are placed in a First In, First Out (FIFO) line that earns a portion of new Bean mints. Pods become [Harvestable](../../protocol/glossary.md#harvestable-pods) (redeemable) at an indeterminate future time for a fixed number of Beans. Learn more [about the Field](../../farm/field.md) and how to [Sow Beans](../field/sow.md).
* **Barn:** Earn yield and recapitalize Beanstalk with [Fertilizer](../../protocol/glossary.md#fertilizer). Fertilizer earns a portion of new Bean mints up to a fixed return. Learn more [about the Barn](../../farm/barn.md) and how to [Buy Fertilizer](../barn/buy-fertilizer.md).
* **Market:** Trade [Pods](../../protocol/glossary.md#pods), the Beanstalk-native debt asset, redeemable for Beans. Learn more [about the Market](../../farm/market.md) and how to [Buy Pods](../market/buy-pods.md).

**Returning to Beanstalk as a pre-exploit Farmer?** Your pre-exploit assets regain value in accordance with the success of the [Barn Raise](../../protocol/glossary.md#barn-raise) and growth of the Bean supply thereafter. Learn more [about the Barn](../../farm/barn.md) and how to [Pick Unripe Assets](../unripe-assets/pick-unripe-assets.md) and [Enroot your Revitalized Stalk and Seeds](../silo/claim-rewards.md#enroot).
