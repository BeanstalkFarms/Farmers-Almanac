# Where to Begin

**New to Beanstalk?** Learn the basics by reading [Why Beanstalk](../../introduction/why-beanstalk.md) and [How Beanstalk Works](../../introduction/how-beanstalk-works.md).&#x20;

The [Beanstalk whitepaper](https://bean.money/docs/beanstalk.pdf) is the authoritative source of protocol documentation while the Farmers' Almanac is more accessible.&#x20;

If you prefer audio content, check out the Beanstalk University recordings in the [Beanstalk Learning Center](../../additional-resources/beanstalk-learning-center.md).
