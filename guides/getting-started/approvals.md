# Approve Contracts

Certain transactions require approving certain smart contracts to process your transaction. When a mode is selected that requires an approval, if you have not yet approved the contract, a special notice will appear and the module will be unusable until you send an approve.

To send an approval for the transaction in question:

1. Select "Approve \[Token]".
2. Confirm the transaction in your wallet and your hardware wallet, if applicable. You should verify that the transaction is interacting with the [correct contract](../../protocol/contracts.md) before signing it.
