# Pick Unripe Assets

[Picking](../../protocol/glossary.md#pick) Unripe assets is a one-time action that pre-exploit Farmers take to claim their [non-Deposited](../../protocol/asset-states.md) Unripe assets.

Upon Replant, Farmers who held Beans in the block prior to the exploit received 1 Unripe Bean for every pre-exploit Bean; Farmers who held whitelisted LP Tokens in the block prior to the exploit received 1 Unripe BEAN:3CRV LP for every 1 Bean Denominated Value (BDV) of each pre-exploit whitelisted LP Token.

You can find more information about Unripe assets [here](../../farm/barn.md#unripe-assets).

1. Make sure you are on [app.bean.money](https://app.bean.money/) and [connect your wallet](../getting-started/connect-wallet.md).
2. Select your wallet address on the top right of the page and in the dropdown menu select “Pick Unripe Assets”.
3. The modal that appears will break down all of your non-Deposited Unripe assets (Unripe Beans and Unripe BEAN:3CRV LP).&#x20;
   * Deposited Unripe assets were Deposited in the Silo automatically upon Replant and do not need to be Picked.
4. Select “Pick Unripe Assets” at the bottom of the modal.
5. In the next “Pick Unripe Assets” modal, you may choose to:&#x20;
   * “Pick Unripe Assets” to transfer them your wallet, or
   * “Pick and Deposit Unripe Assets” to Pick the assets and immediately Deposit them in the Silo in the same transaction.
6. Confirm the transaction in your wallet and your hardware wallet, if applicable. You should verify that the transaction is interacting with the [correct contract](../../protocol/contracts.md) before signing it.
7. After the transaction has been confirmed by the network, the location of your Unripe assets will depend on the option selected in Step 5:&#x20;
   * If “Pick Unripe Assets” was selected, the Unripe assets will be in your wallet. They are also shown on the [Balances](https://app.bean.money/#/balances) page under Circulating Balance.
   * If “Pick and Deposit Unripe Assets” was selected, each asset will be shown on the Silo page for that Unripe asset. They will also appear on the [Balances](https://app.bean.money/#/balances) page under Deposited Balance.
