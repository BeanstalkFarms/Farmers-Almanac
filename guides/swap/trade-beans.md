# Trade Beans

Beans currently trade solely in the [BEAN:3CRV metapool](https://curve.fi/factory/152) on Curve.

1. Go to the [BEAN:3CRV pool on Curve](https://curve.fi/factory/152) or from [curve.fi](https://curve.fi/) under “Curve pools” select “See All Pools” and “Bean”.
2. Connect your wallet to Curve by selecting “Connect wallet”.
3. The BEAN:3CRV metapool facilitates trades between Bean, DAI, USDC, and USDT. Select the asset you want to sell in the “From” input and the asset you want to buy in the “To” input, and enter the amount to trade.
4. Verify the amount you will receive under the “To” output. The effective “Exchange rate” is listed below.
5. You may select a slippage tolerance and a gas priority fee under “Advanced options”.
6. Select “Sell”.
7. There will be two transactions to confirm in your wallet and your hardware wallet, if applicable. The first transaction is an approval transaction to allow the metapool to spend the asset you are selling. The second transaction completes the trade. You should verify that the transactions are interacting with the [correct contract](https://etherscan.io/address/0xc9C32cd16Bf7eFB85Ff14e0c8603cc90F6F2eE49) before signing it.
8. If you bought Beans, they may not appear in your wallet until you add the Bean ERC-20 contract. See Add Bean to MetaMask for instructions. Your Circulating Balance is also shown on [app.bean.money](https://app.bean.money/) on the [Balances](https://app.bean.money/#/balances) page.
