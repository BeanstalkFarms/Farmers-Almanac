# Mint BeaNFTs

BeaNFTs can be viewed and minted on the [BeaNFTs](https://app.bean.money/#/nft) page. See the [BeaNFT documentation](../../ecosystem/beanfts.md) for more info.

1. Make sure you are on [app.bean.money](https://app.bean.money/) and [connect your wallet](../getting-started/connect-wallet.md).
2. Select “More” then “BeaNFTs” to navigate to the [BeaNFTs](https://app.bean.money/#/nft) page.
3. Switch the current tab to the collection in which you have an unminted BeaNFT.
4. If you would like to mint a single BeaNFT from the selected collection, select an unminted BeaNFT and select "Mint" in the modal. If you would like to mint all unminted BeaNFTs in the selected collection, select "Mint All \[Collection]" in the top right of the component.
5. Confirm the transaction in your wallet and your hardware wallet, if applicable. You should verify that the transaction is interacting with the [correct contract](../../protocol-resources/contracts.md) before signing it.
6. After the transaction has been confirmed by the network, the minted BeaNFT(s) will be sent to your wallet. You can still view them on the [BeaNFT](https://app.bean.money/#/nft) page or on a site like [OpenSea](https://opensea.io/account).
