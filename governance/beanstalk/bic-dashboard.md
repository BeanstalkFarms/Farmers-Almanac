# BIC Dashboard

**The Beanstalk Immunefi Committee, or BIC, determines the categorization and payout of bug bounties in accordance with the bug bounty program structure approved by the DAO in** [**BIP-26**](https://github.com/BeanstalkFarms/Beanstalk-Governance-Proposals/blob/master/bip/bip-26-bug-bounty-program.md). The [Beanstalk Community Multisig](bcm-process.md) (BCM) executes the will of the BIC as determined by [BIRs](../proposals.md#bir), up to 3,000,000 Beans total. Read more [here](bic-process.md).

**Beans minted per BIR so far: 0 Beans**

### **BIC Members**

{% hint style="warning" %}
The following addresses do not custody any funds and are not signers on any multisigâ€”they are simply used by BIC members to propose and vote on [BIRs](../proposals.md#bir) on the [Beanstalk Bug Bounty Snapshot](https://snapshot.org/#/beanstalkbugbounty.eth) page.
