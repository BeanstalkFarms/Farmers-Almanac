# Beanstalk Farms

Beanstalk Farms is a decentralized development organization of core contributors working on Beanstalk, operating across the stack on technical and non-technical problems.

Neither Beanstalk Farms nor Beanstalk have a treasury. Beanstalk Farms has historically been funded by the Beanstalk DAO. Beanstalk Farms proposes quarterly budget BIPs that mint Beans to cover operating expenses and compensate contributors. Budget funds are custodied by the [Beanstalk Farms Multisig (BFM)](bfm-dashboard.md). Larger payments in non-Bean assets like audits have typically been paid for via [Fundraiser](../../farm/fundraiser.md).

Past BIPs that funded Beanstalk Farms:

* [BIP-1: Beanstalk Farms Q4 2021 Dev and Marketing Budget](https://github.com/BeanstalkFarms/Beanstalk/blob/master/bips/bip-1.md)
* [BIP-8: Beanstalk Q1 2022 Budget](https://github.com/BeanstalkFarms/Beanstalk/blob/master/bips/bip-8.md) (included Beanstalk Farms and Bean Sprout)
* [BIP-14: Beanstalk Farms Q2 2022 Budget](https://github.com/BeanstalkFarms/Beanstalk/blob/master/bips/bip-14.md)
