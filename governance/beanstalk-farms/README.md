# Beanstalk Farms

The Beanstalk DAO is responsible for the formation of two independent, symbiotic organizations with distinct mandates: Beanstalk Farms and [Bean Sprout](../bean-sprout/) (a Beanstalk accelerator program).

Beanstalk Farms is a decentralized development organization of core contributors working on Beanstalk, operating across the stack on technical and non-technical problems.

### Funding

Neither Beanstalk Farms nor Beanstalk have a treasury. Beanstalk Farms has historically been funded by the Beanstalk DAO. Beanstalk Farms proposes quarterly budget BIPs that mint Beans to cover operating expenses and compensate contributors. Budget funds are custodied by the [Beanstalk Farms Multisig (BFM)](bfm-dashboard.md). Larger payments in non-Bean assets like audits have typically been paid for via [Fundraiser](../../protocol/fundraiser.md).

Past BIPs that funded Beanstalk Farms:

* [BIP-1: Beanstalk Farms Q4 2021 Dev and Marketing Budget](https://github.com/BeanstalkFarms/Beanstalk-Governance-Proposals/blob/master/bip/bip-01-bf-budget-q4-2021.md)
* [BIP-8: Beanstalk Q1 2022 Budget](https://github.com/BeanstalkFarms/Beanstalk-Governance-Proposals/blob/master/bip/bip-08-beanstalk-budget-q1-2022.md) (included Beanstalk Farms and Bean Sprout)
* [BIP-14: Beanstalk Farms Q2 2022 Budget](https://github.com/BeanstalkFarms/Beanstalk-Governance-Proposals/blob/master/bip/bip-14-bf-budget-q2-2022.md)
* [BIP-22: Beanstalk Farms Q3 2022 Budget](https://github.com/BeanstalkFarms/Beanstalk-Governance-Proposals/blob/master/bip/bip-22-bf-budget-q3-2022.md)
* [BIP-25: Beanstalk Farms Q4 2022 Budget](https://github.com/BeanstalkFarms/Beanstalk-Governance-Proposals/blob/master/bip/bip-25-bf-budget-q4-2022.md)

### Beanstalk Farms Committee

The Beanstalk Farms Committee (BFC) is the group of Beanstalk Farms contributors that has discretion over the Beanstalk Farms budget, including contributor compensation. The BFC hires at and dismisses contributors from Beanstalk Farms.

Beanstalk Farms Committee Proposals, or BFCPs, are proposals related to personnel on the BFC. The Beanstalk DAO governs the BFC. The Beanstalk DAO adds contributors to the BFC via BFCP-As, removes contributors from the BFC via BFCP-Bs, and renews the terms of existing BFC members via BFCP-Cs.&#x20;

Any Stalkholder with 0.1% of the Stalk supply can propose a BFCP-A or BFCP-B. There is no maximum number of BFC members, which facilitates permissionlessness.

See [#bfcp](../proposals.md#bfcp "mention") for more info on each BFCP proposal type. BFCPs are proposed on the [Beanstalk Farms Snapshot page](https://snapshot.org/#/beanstalkfarms.eth). Stalkholders can vote on BFCPs on the [Beanstalk UI Governance page](https://app.bean.money/#/governance?type=beanstalk-farms). Past BFCPs can be read [here](https://github.com/BeanstalkFarms/Beanstalk-Governance-Proposals/tree/master/bfcp).

Beanstalk Farms Budget Proposals, or BFBPs, are proposals related to the use of the Beanstalk Farms budget. Only BFC members can propose and vote on BFBPs.

The BFC hires contributors via BFBP-As, dismisses contributors via BFBP-Bs, and otherwise uses the Beanstalk Farms budget via BFBP-Cs.

See [#bfbp](../proposals.md#bfbp "mention") for more info on each BFBP proposal type. BFBPs are proposed on the [Beanstalk Farms Budget Snapshot page](https://snapshot.org/#/beanstalkfarmsbudget.eth), which is where BFC members vote. Past BFBPs can be read [here](https://github.com/BeanstalkFarms/Beanstalk-Governance-Proposals/tree/master/bfbp).
