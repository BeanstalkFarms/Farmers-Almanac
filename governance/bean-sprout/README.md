* [BIP-8: Beanstalk Q1 2022 Budget](https://github.com/BeanstalkFarms/Beanstalk-Governance-Proposals/blob/master/bip/bip-08-beanstalk-budget-q1-2022.md) (included Beanstalk Farms and Bean Sprout)
* [BIP-23: Bean Sprout Q3 2022 Budget](https://github.com/BeanstalkFarms/Beanstalk-Governance-Proposals/blob/master/bip/bip-23-bs-budget-q3-2022.md)

### Spending

{% hint style="info" %}
Currently, Bean Sprout is not actively funded. The last Bean Sprout budget was the Q4 2022 budget. Past BSPs can be read [here](https://github.com/BeanstalkFarms/Beanstalk-Governance-Proposals/blob/master/bsp).
{% endhint %}

Bean Sprout Proposals, or BSPs, are proposals to use the Bean Sprout budget. Anyone with 0.1% of the Stalk supply or [BSM](bsm-dashboard.md) signers can propose a BSP. BSPs are voted on by Stalkholders.&#x20;

BSPs that propose to spend less than or equal to 25,000 Beans are optimistically approved unless a quorum of 10% of the Stalk supply is reached, after which the majority vote determines the outcome of the vote. BSPs that propose to spend more than 25,000 Beans must reach a quorum of 10% of the Stalk supply and a majority vote For in order to pass.
