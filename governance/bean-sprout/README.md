# Bean Sprout

Bean Sprout is a Beanstalk accelerator program to facilitate rapid development on and around Beanstalk in a decentralized fashion.

Like Beanstalk Farms, Bean Sprout does not have a treasury and has historically received a budget from the Beanstalk DAO via BIP. Budget funds are custodied by the [Bean Sprout Multisig (BSM)](bsm-dashboard.md).

Past BIPs that funded Beanstalk Sprout:

* [BIP-8: Beanstalk Q1 2022 Budget](https://github.com/BeanstalkFarms/Beanstalk/blob/master/bips/bip-8.md) (included Beanstalk Farms and Bean Sprout)

BSPs (Bean Sprout Proposals) are proposed on the Beanstalk Farms Snapshot page (Bean Sprout currently uses the same Snapshot page as Beanstalk Farms). In general, these are proposals to use the Bean Sprout budget.
