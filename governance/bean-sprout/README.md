# Bean Sprout

Bean Sprout is a Beanstalk accelerator program to facilitate rapid development on and around Beanstalk in a decentralized fashion. Bean Sprout is responsible for the incubation of [Root](../../additional-resources/root.md).

### Funding

Like Beanstalk Farms, Bean Sprout does not have a treasury and has historically received a budget from the Beanstalk DAO via BIP. Budget funds are custodied by the [Bean Sprout Multisig (BSM)](bsm-dashboard.md).

Past BIPs that funded Beanstalk Sprout:

* [BIP-8: Beanstalk Q1 2022 Budget](https://github.com/BeanstalkFarms/Beanstalk-Governance-Proposals/blob/master/bip/bip-08-beanstalk-budget-q1-2022.md) (included Beanstalk Farms and Bean Sprout)
* [BIP-23: Bean Sprout Q3 2022 Budget](https://github.com/BeanstalkFarms/Beanstalk-Governance-Proposals/blob/master/bip/bip-23-bs-budget-q3-2022.md)

### Spending

Bean Sprout Proposals, or BSPs, are proposals to use the Bean Sprout budget.

Anyone with 0.1% of the Stalk supply or [BSM](bsm-dashboard.md) signers can propose a BSP. BSPs are voted on by Stalkholders and are optimistically approved unless a quorum of 10% of the Stalk supply is reached, after which the majority vote determines the outcome of the vote.

See [#bsp](../proposals.md#bsp "mention") for more info on BSPs. BSPs are proposed on the [Bean Sprout Snapshot page](https://snapshot.org/#/wearebeansprout.eth). Stalkholders can vote on BSPs on the [Beanstalk UI Governance page](https://app.bean.money/#/governance?type=bean-sprout). Past BSPs can be read [here](https://github.com/BeanstalkFarms/Beanstalk-Governance-Proposals/tree/master/bsp).
