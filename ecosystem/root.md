# Root

Root is a generalized marketplace protocol built on Beanstalk.&#x20;

Root is designed as a rent-free, public good protocol and plans to support many types of permissionless markets. Rent comes not only in the form of non-zero platform fees, but also in the requirement to use money with negative carrying costs. Instead of rent-based markets, Root creates a new zero-fee, positive carry market structure and accounts for transactions in Bean Denominated Value (BDV).

Market types Root will support include:

* **Prediction markets** like sports betting and political elections;
* **Financial markets** such as Bean interest rate swaps and asset futures; and
* **Commerce markets** via NFT-represented assets, goods, and services.
