# Basin

Basin is a composable EVM-native decentralized exchange protocol.

Well designed open source protocols enable anyone to (1) compose existing components together, (2) develop new components when existing ones fail to meet the needs of users or are cost-inefficient and (3) verify the proper use of existing components in a simple fashion. Basin allows for anyone to compose new and existing (1) _Well Functions_ (i.e. exchange functions), (2) _Pumps_ (i.e., network native oracles) and (3) _Well Implementations_ (i.e., exchange implementations) to create a _Well_ (i.e., a customized liquidity pool). _Aquifers_ (i.e., Well registries) store a mapping from Well addresses to Well Implementations to enable verification of a Well Implementation given a Well address.
