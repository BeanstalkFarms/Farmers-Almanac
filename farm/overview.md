# Overview

The Farm is the Beanstalk ecosystem. Anyone can become a Farmer by interacting with Beanstalk.

The Farm has five primary components: the Sun, Silo, Field, Market and Depot.

The [Sun](sun.md) offers payment for participation in timekeeping and regular code execution. Time on the Farm is kept in Seasons.

The [Silo](silo.md)—the Beanstalk DAO—offers passive yield opportunities to owners of Bean and other whitelisted assets for participation in governance of Beanstalk upgrades and contribution to security, liquidity and stability.

The [Field](field.md) offers yield opportunities to creditors for participating in peg maintenance.

The [Market](market.md) offers zero-fee trading to anyone on the Ethereum network.

The [Depot](depot.md) facilitates interactions with other protocols through Beanstalk in a single transaction.

The [Barn](barn.md) is the Beanstalk recapitalization facility being used to Replant Beanstalk but is not a primary component of the Farm.
