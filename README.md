# Farmers' Almanac

![](.gitbook/assets/logo.png)

Beanstalk is a permissionless fiat stablecoin protocol built on Ethereum.

Beanstalk forms the monetary basis of an Ethereum-native, rent-free economy facilitated by the seigniorage of its native fiat currency, a stablecoin called Bean.

A stablecoin that does not compromise on decentralization nor require collateral, has competitive carrying costs, and trends toward more stability and liquidity, will unlock the potential of DeFi. Beanstalkâ€™s primary objective is to incentivize independent market participants to regularly cross the price of 1 Bean over its dollar peg in a sustainable fashion.

You can find an overview of Beanstalk here:
