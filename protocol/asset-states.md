**Revitalized Seeds** are Seeds that have vested for pre-exploit Silo Members. Revitalized Seeds are minted as the percentage of Fertilizer sold increases. Revitalized Seeds do not generate Stalk until Enrooted. See the [Revitalized Assets](../farm/barn.md#revitalized-assets) section of the [Barn](../farm/barn.md) page for more info.
