### Participating in Beanstalk governance

Become a [Stalkholder](../protocol/glossary.md#stalkholders) and participate in Beanstalk governance by [Depositing whitelisted assets](../farm/silo.md#deposit-whitelist) in the [Silo](../farm/silo.md) to earn [Stalk](../farm/silo.md#the-stalk-system).&#x20;

Read more about [Beanstalk governance](../governance/beanstalk/) and the various[ proposals](../governance/proposals.md).&#x20;

Each governance proposal has a channel for discussion on the [Beanstalk Discord](https://discord.gg/beanstalk).

### Building with Beanstalk and Beans

Beanstalk's [capital efficient model](../introduction/why-beanstalk.md) is designed to facilitate a Bean-based economy of protocols and businesses benefiting from building on Beanstalk and using Beans. Beanstalk welcomes builders and provides a competitive edge to your project.

Discuss business ideas in the **(#💡・business-ideas)** channel on the Beanstalk Discord.

### Submitting improvements to the Beanstalk protocol

The Beanstalk protocol is deployed on Ethereum mainnet. The code base is open source and developed on [GitHub](https://github.com/BeanstalkFarms/Beanstalk). Discuss improvements to Beanstalk in the **(#💡・beanstalk-ideas)** channel in the Beanstalk Discord.&#x20;

Protocol changes are submitted as [Beanstalk Improvement Proposals](../governance/proposals.md#bip) (BIPs) and are committed if passed by Stalkholders.

### Submitting improvements to Beanstalk development tooling

All Beanstalk development tooling, such as the [Beanstalk UI](https://github.com/BeanstalkFarms/Beanstalk/tree/master/projects/ui), [SDK](https://github.com/BeanstalkFarms/Beanstalk/tree/master/projects/sdk) and [Subgraph](https://github.com/BeanstalkFarms/Beanstalk/tree/master/projects/subgraph-beanstalk), are open source.

Leave feedback on the Beanstalk UI in the **(#🌐・ui-feedback)** channel and discuss improvements to Beanstalk development tooling in the **(#🪵・development)** channel in the Beanstalk Discord.

### Submitting improvements to Beanstalk documentation

Documentation around Beanstalk is continually improving and help is more than welcome.&#x20;

Leave feedback in the **(#📜・docs-feedback)** channel on the Beanstalk Discord or make a pull request directly to:&#x20;

* the [Farmers' Almanac repository](https://github.com/BeanstalkFarms/Farmers-Almanac);
* the [Agronomics Handbook repository](https://github.com/BeanstalkFarms/Agronomics-Handbook);
* the [Beanstalk Whitepaper repository](https://github.com/BeanstalkFarms/Beanstalk-Whitepaper); or
* the [Pipeline Whitepaper repository](https://github.com/BeanstalkFarms/Pipeline-Whitepaper).

### Receiving a grant for increasing awareness and education

The community grant program aims to reward community members for creating quality content about the Beanstalk ecosystem.

A budget of 30,000 Beans per month is allocated to creators of new Beanstalk-related content that focuses on Beanstalk and its role in the broader DeFi ecosystem.

For more information, see [Community Grant Program](community-grant-program.md).

### Becoming a contributor at Beanstalk Farms

[Beanstalk Farms](../governance/beanstalk-farms/) is a decentralized development organization of core contributors working on Beanstalk, operating across the stack on technical and non-technical problems.&#x20;

If you are interested in contributing to Beanstalk Farms, check out the [Jobs](https://bean.money/jobs) page and fill out the form.&#x20;

### Becoming a member of the Beanstalk Farms Committee

Hiring for Beanstalk Farms is performed by the [Beanstalk Farms Committee](../governance/beanstalk-farms/#beanstalk-farms-committee) (BFC). You can join the BFC yourself through a [BFCP-A proposal](../governance/proposals.md#bfcp-a).

### Funding your own development organization

Decentralization of development of the Beanstalk protocol is critical to the long term success of Beanstalk. Anyone can propose a [BIP](../governance/proposals.md#bip) to the DAO in order to mint Beans to fund their own organization.
